## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

During this project which is my first ever on FrontendMentor I learned
to combine both CSS Grid for overall layout and stucture and Flexbox
for some inner components.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xMQfnTU6oo) - This helped me getting comfortable working with CSS Grid.
- [Flexbox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YW65K6LcIA&t=9s) - This helped me getting comfortable working with Flebox.
